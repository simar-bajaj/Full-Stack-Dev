1. Make changes in class in div with #headingGroup so that it gets hidden when the screen size is smaller than lg, visible otherwise.
Hint:
<div class="d-none d-lg-block">hide on screens smaller than lg</div>

2. The Navbar should collapse at small screen size.

3. Once the screen size is medium and the images and text fall one below the other, the order should be such that the image and the text are alternative to each other. Inother words, two images should not fall one below the other, there should be text between the two images.
Hint:
Use order-1,order-2, order-md-2 and order-md-1 utilities.
